# plotly-challenge

In this challenge, we build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the micrbes that colonize human navels. 
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

We use d3 library to read sample json files and plot our dashboards
